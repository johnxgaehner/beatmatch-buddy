hi! 👋

This is / will be my app Beatmatch Buddy. 🤝 Beatmatch Buddy is a tool to help upcoming vinyl record deejays. You can analyse the tempo of a track, save the result in your collection and prepare the playlist of your next gig. 💿💨 When spinning vinyl records it is a big help to know the tempo of a track and if the next track you want to play is in the same tempo range to avoid big jumps and make the smoothest transitions.
The times where you have to write notes on record covers are over now!

### 🆘 problem:

- I want to spin vinyl records but I am a beginner
- how fast is the actual track and how fast is the next track?
- which track can I play next in the same tempo range?

### ✅ solution:

- analyse the tempo of a track by tapping along the beat
- build a collection (bpm cheat sheet) including all your analyzed tracks
- compile tracklists with your newly gained knowledge of every track tempo

### 🆒 additional features:

- filter & sort your collection by keywords, tempo (range), names etc.
- add one track to multiple playlists or add multiple tracks to one playlist
- re-arrange the track order of your playlists by drag & drop
- delete a track or the whole playlist when you don't need it anymore
- a lot more...

### 🛠️ tech stack:

- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript / React
