hi! 👋

This is / will be my app Beatmatch Buddy. 🤝 Beatmatch Buddy is a tool to help upcoming vinyl record deejays. You can analyse the tempo of a song, save the result in your collection and compile the tracklist for your next gig. 💿💨 When spinning vinyl records it is a big help to know the tempo of a song and if the next song you want to play is in the same tempo range.
The times where you have to write notes on the record cover are over!

### 🆘 problem:
- I want to spin vinyl records but I am a beginner
- how fast is the actual track and how fast is the next track?
- which track can I play next in the same tempo range?

### ✅ solution:
- Beat Detection using JavaScript algorithm
- possibility to build a collection (bpm cheat sheet)
- possibility to compile tracklists with the knowledge of every tempo in your collection

### 🆒 additional features:
- filter your collection by keywords, tempo (range), date added etc.
- re-arrange the track order of your playlists by drag & drop
- calculate the pitch % difference from one song to another

### 🛠️ tech stack:
- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript / React
- LocalStorage
- maybe P5.js
