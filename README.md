hi! 👋

This is / will be my app Beatmatch Buddy. 🤝 Beatmatch Buddy is a tool to help upcoming vinyl record deejays. You can analyse the tempo of a track, save the result in your collection and prepare the playlist of your next gig. 💿💨 When spinning vinyl records it is a big help to know the tempo of a track and if the next track you want to play is in the same tempo range to avoid big jumps and make the smoothest transitions.
The times where you have to write notes on record covers are over now!
