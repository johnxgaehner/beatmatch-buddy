hi! 👋

This is / will be my app Beatmatch Buddy. 🤝 Beatmatch Buddy is a little tool to help upcoming vinyl record deejays. You can analyse the tempo of a song with your mobile microphone, save the result in your collection and compile the tracklist for your next gig. 💿💨 When spinning vinyl records it is a big help to know the tempo of a song and if the next song you want to play is in the same tempo range.
The times where you have to tap the tempo and write notes on the record cover are over!


### 🆘 problem:
- I want to spin vinyl records but I am a beginner
- how fast is the actual track and how fast is the next track?
- which track can I play next in the same tempo range?

### ✅ solution:
- Beat Detection using JavaScript & the web audio api
- record audio through micro and count peaks within a given time

### 🆒 additional features:
- save results in collection (maybe using Discogs api)
- filter your collection by tempo (range), date added etc.
- compile & prepare a track list (show % pitch difference)
- tap tempo if sound recording does not work in this situation

### 🛠️ tech stack:
- JavaScript / React
- Web Audio API
- maybe P5.js
